   <div><p class="headingsmallinfo"> We are located in Melbourne / Naarm, Australia. We sell out of print books, magazines, and other things we find interesting. We also collaborate with friends, and other practitioners to produce works relating to printed matter and it's auxiliaries.<br/><br/> 
	   
	   pricing; All of our items are priced in Australian Dollars (AUD $). The prices are fixed, and have already taken into account the state of each item. However if you feel as though we have mispriced an item, please email us and we will work towards a mutual agreement.<br/><br/> 
	   
	   shipping; We offer domestic shipping at a flat rate of $10 AUD. International shipping is based upon Austalia Post International Shipping Costs. These costs will be calculated and sent to the purchaser as a seperate payment via PayPal. For information regarding these prices before a purchase, please email us. Listed below is an approximate guideline for these costs. <br/><i>Any item that weighs above 2kg and is being shipped internationally is priced at a flat rate of $60 AUD.</i><br/><br/> 
	   
	   Items weighing 0kg - 0.5kg are approximately $25 AUD. Items weighing 0.6kg - 1kg are approximately $40 AUD. Items weighing 1.1kg - 1.5kg are approximately $50 AUD. Items weighing 1.6kg - 2kg are approximately $60 AUD. <br/><br/>
	   
	   <a class="headingsmallinfored"> Some older items on our webstore have already been coded with a $10 shipping cost. This $10 payment will be calculated into the additional shipping cost for international customers. For customers within Australia purchasing multiple items, this $10 cost will be automatically applied via PayPal. We will refund these extra costs within 72 hours of your purchase - we apologise for any inconvenience. <br/><br/></a>
	   
	   returns policy; We offer returns for both domestic and international customers. To request a return, please email offpressbooks@outlook.com within 5 days of receiving your item/s. A full refund will be given if the item/s are returned in original condition.
