	    <p>Based in Berkeley, California, Emigre was founded by Rudy VanderLans and Zuzana Licko. Starting in 1984, the pair utilised new technologies of which hadn't previously been explored in the field of graphic design, granting them wide spread acclaim. Emigre Magazine was first published in 1984 and was a way to showcase the groups new typefaces, as well as analysing the current state of graphic design globally; through interviews and articles with important figures of the time. Emigre Magazine gained wide spread success with their original format, using an exaggerated size of 285mm x 425mm, they were able to embrace experimental layouts, and large scale artworks. The magazine grew synonymous for it’s interviews, and articles; thus becoming more text heavy, leading to a change in format at issue 33. The US Letter format supported a new, almost journalistic approach to the magazines content. The magazines last issue was in 2005, however Emigre still operates as a type foundry and remains an authority on contemporary graphic design today.<br/><br/>
