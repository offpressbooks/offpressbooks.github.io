	    <p>Speak's founder/editor Dan Rolleri was hugely inspired by the unruly aesthetic of Raygun magazine. David Carson of Raygun Magazine came on as art director, however only stayed for the magazines second issue. Carson's role was assumed by the magazines original art director; College graduate Martin Venezky. Venezky's own style would define Speak until it's final issue in 2001. Although a short-lived existence, Speak garnered a reputation for interviews with the lesser known artists, theorists, musicians, and others within society that they found interesting; becoming a time capsule for global culture during the 1990s.<br/><br/> 
		    
"Speak's relaunch, with art director David Carson. The magazine inexplicably begins at the center spread, then moves left and right to either cover. (That's right, half the magazine read backwards.) The cover, still one of my favorites, created lots of controversy. The work of artist John Huggins, the illustration was to accompany an article on the creation of the Joe Camel mascot. The issue was banned from various newsstands in the South because of the cover's imagery and offensive language. In addition, many readers were disturbed by its "celebration of smoking," while a certain cigarette company thought that it mocked them. Most unexpectedly, because of the new Speak logo, a number of people believed the magazine's name was "Cool-Ass." - Dan Rolleri<br/><br/>
		   
 <i>In this issue,</i>"<b> My Date with Rollins</b> by Adam Kaye. In which journalist turns perfomance artist and finds that rocks man of steel has feet of clay. This was to be the cover story from Raygun #1, but was surpressed until now because of irreverence. <b>London Calling</b> by Byron O'Neill, photographs by Corrine Day. <b>The Mine Game</b> by Liz Farrelly. Graphic artists work to inform young Laotians and Cambodians of land-mine dangers." <b>And More</b>.<br/><br/>
