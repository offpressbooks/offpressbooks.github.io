	    <p>8vo, founded by Simon Johnston, Mark Holt and Hamish Muir was a design led studio with a focus on typography. The groups practice was heavily informed by Swiss, and Modernist typography from Europe. This was a contrast to the graphic work in London at the time, which lacked the rigidity and structure of Modernist design. Octavo was a magazine published by 8vo, intermittently between 1986 to 1992, which focused on graphic design methodology, and it’s historical and contemporary application. The magazine used new techniques in printing to showcase technological advancements of the time. With a small print run of around 4000 each issue, the magazine developed a cult following among young designers and industry professionals. 8vo would go on to produce prolific work for major clients such as; ‘Edinburgh FLUX Festival’, and ‘Hacienda/Factory Records’, retaining their experimental approach to layouts and systems highlighted throughout Octavo magazine.<br/><br/>
		    
<i>In this issue,</i> A discussion on lower-case letterforms. “the lower-case theme of this issue may initially seem somewhat esoteric, but in many ways it is a microcosm of a larger debate, one which raises pertinent questions about the potential of design to be part of a force for positive social change, rather than merely a grinning, compliant service industry.” - 8vo<br/><br/>
