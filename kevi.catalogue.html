    <div class="info">
	    <p>Designed by Jorgen Rasmussen, the Kevi chair was created to improve functionality within an office, and industrial environment. Jorgen Rasmussen graduated from Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1955, and together with his brother, the pair started an architecture studio with a focus on small housing. After building a house for Kevi a/s CEO, Bent Harlang, the pair were commissioned to design furniture for Kevi a/s. The pair designed many chairs for Kevi a/s over the years, with the 'Kevi Chair' being their greatest success, designed in 1958. Manufactured in the United States by Herman Miller up until 2008, the 'Kevi Chair' now stands as a icon for mid-century design. It is still manufactured to this day, by Engelbrechts, in Copenhagen, Denmark.<br/><br/>     
		    
This rare catalogue, printed in Denmark by Saloprint, is a special piece of mid-century design ephemera. The cover of the folder (which houses 5 seperate brochures) is designed by Dutch artist Per Arnoldi, who was originally commissioned by Herman Miller in 1976 to produce a poster advertisement for the company. Each seperate brochure showcases a new model by Kevi a/s, with colour photos, and accompanying text, as well as design specifications. The catalogue also comes with an original 'Contract Price List' produced by the Danish Design Centre, for a furniture store in North Sydney, NSW.<br/><br/>
