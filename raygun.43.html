<p>Raygun was a monthly magazine founded by Marvin Scott Jarrett in Santa Monica, California, with its first issue published in 1992. The magazine served to inform its readers of the latest trends in music and style. Artistic Director David Carson’s subversive agenda was influential in setting the magazine apart from the neo-modernist approach to layouts and typography, commonly seen throughout 1990s. Jarrett’s time at popular American Rock ’n’ Roll magazine, ‘Creem’, informed Raygun’s focus on music; however, its content took a more contemporary approach, looking to give agency to lesser known, up and coming artists. Raygun also served as an important source for 90s fashion trends, with its grunge aesthetic being an ideal platform to showcase designers.<br/><br/>
		    
<i>In this issue,</i> key features include interviews with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, and iconic British electronic-dance band The Prodigy. Amongst many other interviews is one with Michael Dorf, founder of ‘Knitting Factory’, a music venue and now record label which was pivotal for Manhattan’s music scene of the late 80s and 90s. Fashion features include the work of Davide Sorrenti, with styling from his sibling and now highly regarded fashion photographer Vanina Sorrenti, as well as a feature with styling by Bernadette Van Huy of Bernadette Corporation.<br/><br/>
