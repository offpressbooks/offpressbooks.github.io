	    <p>Sleazenation began as a club listings magazine, handed out for free to club-goers, with articles more focused on causing controversy than to inform. Not much changed throughout its lifespan, however, articles tackled issues from around the globe, and a price tag was put on it. Founded by Adam Dewhurst and John Swinstead, the pair put together a team of like minded creatives, all with an unflinching perspective on politics, current affairs, style, and much more. Similar to magazines such as The Face, Sleazenation became associated with documenting nightlife, and street style during the late 90s and early 2000s.<br/><br/> 
		    
<i>In this issue,</i>"<b>John Waters</b>, 'The Professional Deviant' talks about his new film Pecker and getting recognised in the public gallery at serial killer trials. <b>Perks</b>, Melbourne's graffiti grappler. <b>Pictorial essay on the matter of spring/summer wardrobe</b>, For the aid of young ladies in confusion. <b>And More</b>.<br/><br/>
