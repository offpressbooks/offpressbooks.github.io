<p>Raygun was a monthly magazine founded by Marvin Scott Jarrett in Santa Monica, California, with its first issue published in 1992. The magazine served to inform its readers of the latest trends in music and style. Artistic Director David Carson’s subversive agenda was influential in setting the magazine apart from the neo-modernist approach to layouts and typography, commonly seen throughout 1990s. Jarrett’s time at popular American Rock ’n’ Roll magazine, ‘Creem’, informed Raygun’s focus on music; however, its content took a more contemporary approach, looking to give agency to lesser known, up and coming artists. Raygun also served as an important source for 90s fashion trends, with its grunge aesthetic being an ideal platform to showcase designers.<br/><br/>
		    
<i>In this issue,</i> an interview with Mazzy Star’s Hope Sandoval and David Roback affirms the pairs disinterest for being questioned, while featuring portraits of Sandoval photographed by Melodie Mcdaniel. Other interviews include John Cale, The Cure, Dj Shadow, as well as Future Sound of London, accompanied with artworks by the band and Phil Knott. Two style features include both, New York street scenes photographed by Butch Belair, as well as a more playful scene  photographed by John Scarisbrick with key pieces from a new wave American designers of the 90s such as Betsey Johnson, whose designs have remained a pivotal reference to their era.<br/><br/>
