<p>Raygun was a monthly magazine founded by Marvin Scott Jarrett in Santa Monica, California, with its first issue published in 1992. The magazine served to inform its readers of the latest trends in music and style. Artistic Director David Carson’s subversive agenda was influential in setting the magazine apart from the neo-modernist approach to layouts and typography, commonly seen throughout 1990s. Jarrett’s time at popular American Rock ’n’ Roll magazine, ‘Creem’, informed Raygun’s focus on music; however, its content took a more contemporary approach, looking to give agency to lesser known, up and coming artists. Raygun also served as an important source for 90s fashion trends, with its grunge aesthetic being an ideal platform to showcase designers.<br/><br/>
		    
<i>In this issue,</i> Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks are interviewed upon the 1995 release of their first collaborative album, Orange Crate Art. The Smashing Pumpkins are interviewed by Managing Editor Dean Kuipers, alongside photography by David Jensen. Also included is a special feature on  The Factory, with excerpts from Lynne Tillman’s novel The Velvet Years: Warhol’s Factory 1965-1967.<br/><br/>
