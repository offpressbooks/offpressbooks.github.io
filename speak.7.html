	    <p>Speak's founder/editor Dan Rolleri was hugely inspired by the unruly aesthetic of Raygun magazine. David Carson of Raygun Magazine came on as art director, however only stayed for the magazines second issue. Carson's role was assumed by the magazines original art director; College graduate Martin Venezky. Venezky's own style would define Speak until it's final issue in 2001. Although a short-lived existence, Speak garnered a reputation for interviews with the lesser known artists, theorists, musicians, and others within society that they found interesting; becoming a time capsule for global culture during the 1990s.<br/><br/> 
		    
"This issue is most noteworthy as being our introduction to cartoonist Chris Ware, who since has contributed a wonderful comic to each issue. This is also the first issue of Speak that wasn't mostly bad." - Dan Rolleri<br/><br/>
