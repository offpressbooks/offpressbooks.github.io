    <div class="info">
	    <p>Speak's founder/editor Dan Rolleri was hugely inspired by the unruly aesthetic of Raygun magazine. David Carson of Raygun Magazine came on as art director, however only stayed for the magazines second issue. Carson's role was assumed by the magazines original art director; College graduate Martin Venezky. Venezky's own style would define Speak until it's final issue in 2001. Although a short-lived existence, Speak garnered a reputation for interviews with the lesser known artists, theorists, musicians, and others within society that they found interesting; becoming a time capsule for global culture during the 1990s.<br/><br/> 
		    
"Speak's debut issue is a train wreck of "fashion and modern culture." Martin Venezky was encouraged to design the hell out of it (and hopefully cover the editorial sins). As a portfolio of Martin's most aggressive work, at least the issue served a purpose for somebody." - Dan Rolleri<br/><br/>
