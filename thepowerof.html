	    <p>Jan Fabre’s The Power of Theatrical Madness was an avant-garde response to historical theatre tropes. Fabre’s use of contemporary dance, and strong artistic direction, was relatively new to theatre of the early 1980s. Referencing tales such as Hans Christian Andersen’s The Emperors New Clothes, Fabre reframes such pieces in order to criticise traditions, and to put forward a contemporary approach to storytelling. Photographer Robert Mapplethorpe has documented Fabre’s play, through a series of studio portraits taken in Antwerp, Belgium; where Fabre lived and worked. The black and white photographs are in distinct Mapplethorpe style, often imbued with a slight eroticism, encapsulating the raw beauty of each subject. Alongside Mapplethorpe’s photographs, are duo-tone sketches by Fabre, depicting poses within the play, that have been used as reference by Mapplethorpe in order to construct his images. This book remains an important physical archive for the body of work created by Fabre and Mapplethorpe, during the period of 1984-1988.<br/><br/>
		    
The book includes an introduction by American writer Kathy Acker, and essay by Italian art critic and theorist, Germano Celant.<br/><br/>
