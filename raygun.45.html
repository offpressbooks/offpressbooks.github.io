<p>Raygun was a monthly magazine founded by Marvin Scott Jarrett in Santa Monica, California, with its first issue published in 1992. The magazine served to inform its readers of the latest trends in music and style. Artistic Director David Carson’s subversive agenda was influential in setting the magazine apart from the neo-modernist approach to layouts and typography, commonly seen throughout 1990s. Jarrett’s time at popular American Rock ’n’ Roll magazine, ‘Creem’, informed Raygun’s focus on music; however, its content took a more contemporary approach, looking to give agency to lesser known, up and coming artists. Raygun also served as an important source for 90s fashion trends, with its grunge aesthetic being an ideal platform to showcase designers.<br/><br/>
		    
<i>In this issue,</i> Interviews with groups Rockers Hi-Fi and Morning Glories. Imagery of works from Hope Joyce Atkinson appear alongside an article on America’s growing interest into Art Brute, or Outsider Art, as it is more commonly known as outside of Europe. Also in this issue is a special style insert dedicated to Davide Sorrenti, the fashion photographer, who had been an ongoing contributor to Raygun and whose work is regarded as a catalyst for the heroin chic movement of the 90s. The feature includes 4 different fashion stories, including pieces from designers such as Alexander Mcqueen, Helmut Lang, Vivienne Westwood and more.<br/><br/>
